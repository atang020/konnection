        <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>CKI (Circle K International) is a collegiate organization that is
          devoted to helping universities join a global network of responsible
          citizens and leaders with a lifelong commitment to service.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
          <p>CKI began in 1936 as Kiwanis club service project to provide an
            opportunity for ambitious young men to acquire a college education
            by assisting them, with financial problems by means of scholarship
            or part-time employment. Today, CKI boasts a membership of over
            13,000 collegians on more than 500 campuses worldwide. Embodied by
            its tenets of leadership, fellowship, and service at club, district,
            and international levels, CKI continues to grow as the largest
            collegiate service organization!</p>

        <h4>Service</h4>
          <p>UCSD Circle K holds multiple weekly service events and you do not
             have to be a paid member to participate. Our projects range from
             maintaining the campus community garden, to ladling soup at soup
             kitchens, to helping children at Boys and Girls Club. Rides are
             provided to all service events and meeting locations and details
             are disclosed in the event pages which can be located on our
             website calendar.</p>
        <h4>Leadership</h4>
          <p>UCSD Circle K has a multitude of leadership opportunities.
            We have a plethora of committees that are always seeking more
            committee members and would be more than happy to receive member
            input. Furthermore, every event requires a chair, a responsibility
            that anyone may request. Lastly, our club has an Elected Board
            which is chosen by club members every year before Spring Quarter
            and an Appointed Board which is selected by the Elected Board. If
            you want to learn more about our current board as well as specific
            positions, please refer to the Contact Page.</p>
        <h4>Fellowship</h4>
          <p>UCSD Circle K provides an abundance of social and friendship
            opportunities. All of our events are always open to new members
            and can range from hanging out at the California beaches to going
            out for a meal at local San Diego restaurants, to having a board
            game night in the UCSD library. Circle K also has an awesome family
             system that enables more intimate friendships and a great
             mentorship program in which returning members guide new members
             through college. To view upcoming social events, please refer to
             the website calendar.</p>

        <p>I pledge to uphold the Objects of Circle K International, to foster
          compassion and goodwill toward others through service and leadership,
          to develop my abilities and the abilities of all people,<b> AND TO
