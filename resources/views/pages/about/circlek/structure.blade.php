        Secretary make up the Executive Board. </p>
    <h4>Division</h4>

    <p>Each club is part of a division, which is comprised of other clubs within a close demographic area.

    <h4>District</h4>

    <p>Each club in a division then falls under a district which is usually bounded by state lines. During the annual
        district convention, delegates from all clubs in the district elect a Governor, Secretary, and Treasurer to service on the District Executive Board. A board of district chairs is then appointed in
        order to carry out specific district focuses and events throughout the year in which clubs from all over the
        district can participate and attend. </p>
        
        <p>
        The first Circle K club was founded in 1947, and the California-Nevada-Hawaii District was one of the two
        founding Districts of Circle K International, along with the Michigan District. California-Nevada-Hawaii was
        instrumental in the internationalization of the organization. Chartered on December 12, 1957, the district was
        founded with thirty-one clubs and has grown to over forty clubs at the present.

    <h4>Sub-region</h4>

    <p>Every sub-region is a collective of several bordering districts based on size, demographic, and cultures. Every
        year at International Convention the sub-region elects a Trustee to be the voice and bridge to
        international.</p>
    <h4>International</h4>

    <p>Of all 30 districts in the organization, they together comprise Circle K International. At this level, there is
        an International President and Vice President as well as 7 elected Sub-regional Trustees and a Trustee-at-Large.
        These Trustees carry out the interests of Circle K international as a whole, as well as for each
        individual sub-region.</p>
